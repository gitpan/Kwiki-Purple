Kwiki-Purple is a suite of tools for adding support for purple
numbers to Kwiki. See http://purple.blueoxen.net/ and 
http://purplewiki.blueoxen.net/ for an introduction to the
concepts and goals of Purple Numbers.

This is an improving alpha version. That means:

* Do not rely on the data structures and text formats used in
  this version to remain supported in the future. There's no
  guarantee of backwards compatibility.

* This plugin rewrites your wiki page text before saving it to
  disk. If something goes wrong in this process, your content
  may be lost. Please backup your wiki before experimenting
  with Kwiki::Purple

If you have questions or comments, please contact the author:
Chris Dent <cdent@burningchrome.com>. I'm also around on #kwiki
as cdent.
