* More tests. The existing tests only cover the very basics.

* Create a Sequence index so we can do transclusions from other wikis
  and other sources of nid identified content (such as all the stuff
  that PurpleWiki supports).

* Add CGI action for returning raw and formatted node content.

* Give more nodes nids

* Save more metadata when writing nodes, to eventually support fancy
  things like node type controlled editors.

* Clean up all the globbing, sub overrides, and other stuff that I 
  didn't know how to do well.
