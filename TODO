* Wow, really need some docs

* Create a sequence demon

* Support adding nids to wafl blocks.

* More tests. The existing tests only cover the very basics.

* Give more nodes nids

* Save more metadata when writing nodes, to eventually support fancy
  things like node type controlled editors.

* Clean up all the globbing, sub overrides, and other stuff that I 
  didn't know how to do well.
